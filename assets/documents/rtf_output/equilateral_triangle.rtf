{\par \b Syntax:}\par equilateral_triangle(Point1, Point2, [Var])\par
{\par \b Description:}\par Draws an equilateral triangle defined by one of its sides; that is, by two consecutive vertices. The third point is calculated automatically, but is not defined symbolically. If a lowercase variable is added as a third argument, then the third point is labeled with the variable name and the coordinates of the third point are stored in that variable. The orientation of the triangle is counterclockwise from the first point.\par
{\par \b Example:}\par equilateral_triangle(point(0,0), point(1,0)) draws the equilateral trangle through the points at (0,0), (1,0), and (1/2, \u8730?3/2).\par }
