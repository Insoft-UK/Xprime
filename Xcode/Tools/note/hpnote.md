### UTF16le

**Plain Text Fallback**

The plain text fallback is a duplicate of the note’s content stored at the start of the .hpnote file, with all formatting, styles, and colors removed. It is not normally displayed, but serves as a backup: if the main formatted content cannot be read or is invalid, the plain text version is used instead to ensure the note’s content remains accessible.
